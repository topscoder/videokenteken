You are a world-class software engineer.

I need you to draft a technical software spec for building the following:
A tool to analyze video files, preferably YouTube videos, and find the license plates that are visible in the video. The license plates that are found are stored in a database with reference to the particular video (URL) and the timestamp the plate is found in the video. To prevent false positives, the probability of the found license plate should be variable in code so we can play with it in order to achieve the most clean results.

The project should be able to run on my macbook with intel core i9 cpu, macos operating system and Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB and Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB GPU's.

Think through how you would build it step by step.

Then, respond with the complete spec as a well-organized markdown file.

I will then reply with "build," and you will proceed to implement the exact spec, writing all of the code needed. I will periodically interject with "continue" to >prompt you to keep going. Continue until complete.
